<h2>Academic Excellence</h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
  
<p>Excellence has been a goal and hallmark of Catholic schools since their 
	inception. As early as 1884, the Bishops of the United States meeting in 
	Baltimore declared, "A complete education is inclusive of faith as well as 
	education for the world." The bishops challenged us not to relax our 
	efforts until our schools, "be elevated to the highest educational 
	excellence." St. Mel Catholic School has a 51 year tradition of Integrating 
	Faith with Academic Excellence. We implement high standards, strong 
	motivation, and effective discipline within a caring atmosphere combined to 
	foster excellence and a high quality of student performance that is 
	supported by evidence.</p>
	<p>St. Mel Catholic School takes great pride in remaining in the forefront of 
	Catholic education. Through long range strategic planning our school has 
	the benefit of a self-contained Science Lab complete with scientific 
	instruments and a Smart Board to expand interactive learning experiences. 
	Fran Dellaserra, a veteran teacher of twenty six years, continues to 
	motivate and captivate our middle school students with her lessons. All 
	grades have access to the use of the Science Lab. It's a busy place.</p>
	
	<p>St. Mel is committed to infusing technology into our curriculum. Our 
	students benefit from having a local computer consulting company, Computer 
	Explorers, and Darcy Grieves as our Computer/Technology coordinator who 
	assists in managing the integration of technology across the curriculum. 
	Our entire school is linked to a state-of-the-art Wi-Fi setting and our lab 
	includes 20 computers. Classrooms in grades First through Eighth are 
	equipped with Smart Boards and all teachers have received training to 
	maximize the utility of the Smart Boards. Parents and students benefit 
	tremendously from accessing information from our website, 
	<a href="http://www.stmelschool.org/">www.stmelschool.org</a>  , and signing into the 
	Schoolyard portion of the website. Teachers post their weekly newsletters, 
	homework, field trips, and other pertinent information. At their 
	convenience, parents may access their child's grades including attendance, 
	e-mail teachers with questions, feedback and concerns, read newsworthy 
	items, view the school calendar of events, and download forms.</p>
	
	<p>Our top-notch faculty is well-respected within the Diocese of Sacramento and 
	in the community. They are fully qualified professionals committed to 
	bringing out the best in their students as they grow in knowledge, skills, 
	and values in a faith filled environment. Last year in 2010, St. Mel School 
	participated in the WCEA/WASC accreditation process and earned a full term 
	6-year accreditation, the highest rating a school can achieve. For the past 
	20 years, we have achieved the highest level of accreditation from the 
	Western Catholic Schools Association and the Western Association of Schools 
	and Colleges; a level of achievement few schools can match.</p>
	
	<p>Our fine students are some of the most active and involved students in 
	Sacramento each year. Our seven sports programs consistently compete each 
	year for PAL championships. St. Mel's Athletic Director and P.E. 
	instructor, Molly Nichols, devotes her 11 years of expertise growing these 
	programs to benefit our school. Our twenty plus co-curricular and 
	extra-curricular activities allow students to compete in local and state 
	academic competitions and decathlons as well as expand their passions in the 
	areas of art, drama, foreign language, leadership, and community service, 
	just to name a few. Additionally, individual students are recognized at 
	Monday Morning Assemblies related to the specific Student Learning 
	Expectation (SLE) for the week. Students participate in the Iowa Test of 
	Basic Skills (ITBS) in grades 2nd - 8th. St. Mel students score 
	significantly higher on this test than national and local school averages.</p>
	
	<p>While providing a stimulating and demanding education, St. Mel School 
	practices differentiated learning instruction. Mary Lou Giles, our Resource 
	Specialist with 25 years of experience, coordinates and implements services 
	to students who are in need of support to develop to their full potential. 
	Our Accelerated Math instructor is Marjorie Booth who has been a faculty 
	member since 1999. She provides advanced math instruction to students in 
	grades 4th - 8th who display talent and a willingness to work hard. 
	Participation is based on a combination of ITBS scores and grades.</p>
	
	<p>Our goal at St. Mel Catholic School is to educate the whole child: mind, 
	body, and spirit within an environment that is safe, secure, and 
	well-maintained. St. Mel will continue to aggressively plan for the future 
	and be visionary in identifying and meeting the future needs students and 
	their families.</p>

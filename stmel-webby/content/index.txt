  <h2>Welcome to St. Mel School</h2>
  <div class="col col-large">
    <p>St. Mel School is proud to carry on the traditions from our founders, the Sisters of Mercy.  Since the doors opened 50 years ago, St. Mel School has graduated outstanding young students on their way to being successful high school students.  We are a TK- 8th grade Catholic co-educational elementary and junior high school located in Fair Oaks, California.  The school is accredited by the Western Catholic Educational Association and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.  Our enrollment for the 2010-2011 academic school year is 265 students.</p>

<p>
	We are dedicated to serving our student body and their families by providing an education grounded in the Catholic tradition.  We want our graduates to become valuable members of the greater community by integrating faith with academic excellence.  
</p>
<p>St. Mel Catholic School is accredited by the Western Catholic Educational Association (WCEA).  WCEA accredits Catholic elementary and secondary schools in nine western states (26 (arch) dioceses) and the US Territory of Guam.  WCEA co-accredits and is in partnership with three Regional agencies (WASC, NAAS, NCA CASI) and two private agencies (CAIS and HAIS).   WCEA began in 1957 in San Francisco and has a long and successful history of assisting school improvement through the accreditation process.</p>

  		  <strong>Auction Gift Receiving Begins Monday, October 3</strong>
  		  <p>Beginning this Monday, look for the Auction Gift Receiving crew before and 
        after school. They will be collecting your donations of goods and services, 
        as well as cash donations for this year's benefit auction. You may also 
        "Double Dip" with Scrip by purchasing Scrip that will be donated to the 
        auction. (See Scrip volunteers for specific details.) Meet your $300 parent 
        club contribution requirement early this year by donating to the school's 
        biggest fundraiser of the year! This weekend is a great time to shop, and 
        we've posted donation ideas for you on the Schoolyard portion of the St. Mel 
        School website. For those families who donate during the designated Gift 
        Receiving timeframe (October 3-14), your child will be recognized at an 
        all-school assembly and entered into a raffle for fabulous prizes. In 
        addition, we will post thank you's to families on our website.</p>
        
        <strong>Get your Tickets to the Hottest Event of the Season!</strong>
        <p>Already, in the first week of ticket sales, over 100 auction tickets have 
        been sold! So don't wait - get your tickets now to the hottest event of the 
        school year! Auction tickets are on sale for $55/per person. Look for the 
        ticket sales sign in front of Doheny Hall before and after school, or 
        purchase them in the school office during school hours. Organize a table of 
        friends and family and join the fun at this year's biggest fundraiser!</p>

<h2>Altar Servers</h2>
<div class="col col-large">
  <p>We give our students many opportunities to be active participants in the celebration of the Mass. One very special way St. Mel School boys and girls have to take part in the Mass is by altar service. Beginning in the 6th grade year, all children are invited to train as an altar server. The training is done under the supervision of a volunteer member of the parish. Students are then encouraged to serve at both School and Parish Masses.</p>

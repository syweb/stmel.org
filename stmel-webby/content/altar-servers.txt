<h2>Altar Servers</h2>
<div class="col col-large">
  <p>We give our students many opportunities to be active participants in the celebration of the Mass. One very special way that St. Mel School boys and girls may take part in the Mass is through altar service. Beginning in the 6th grade year, all children are invited to train as altar servers. The training is done under the supervision of a volunteer member of the parish. Students are then encouraged to serve at School and Parish Masses.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<div class="col col-equal">
  <p>St. Mel School was established in 1959 to serve the needs of the growing parish which began in 1949. Reverend William Horgan, the Pastor, at the request of the Most Reverend Joseph L. McGucken, Bishop of Sacramento, invited the Sisters of Mercy of Doon to staff the school. In August of that year, Sister Mary de Pazzi McKeough, Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart Troy, Sister Mary Laurence O’Dea, Sister Mary Rosario Ryan, Sister Mary Assumpta White, and Sister Mary Kieran O’Neill arrived in Fair Oaks to pioneer the work.</p>
  <p>The school opened in September 1959, with students enrolled in grades one through five. In June 1963, the first class of eighth graders graduated and a Kindergarten program was added. In addition, a full time Physical Education teacher was employed to instruct all grades. In September 1977, a part-time Spanish teacher was employed to teach Spanish, and in September 1991, the Spanish program was revised.</p>
  <p>  An accelerated math program for qualified students in grades seven and eight began in 1979; the program was extended in 1980 to include students in grades four through eight.</p>

The Extension Program opened its doors to students before and after school in 1998. An Art Docent program which includes art appreciation and hands-on projects began in January 2004. Transitional Kindergarten (TK) started in August 2004. A Resource teacher joined the faculty in 2006 and provides services to students in grades Kindergarten – 8th. A new Science Lab was constructed and dedicated in 2007.</p>
  <p>Enrollment has remained constant since the last accreditation in 2004. The school population continues to be predominantly Catholic. In 1990, Mrs. Janet Nagel was appointed the first lay principal of St. Mel School. The commitment and direction of the Sisters of Mercy remain a vital force in the implementation of the philosophy of the school.</p>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<div class="col col-equal">
  <p>St. Mel School was established in 1959 to serve the needs of the growing parish which began in 1949. Reverend William Horgan, the Pastor, at the request of the Most Reverend Joseph L. McGucken, Bishop of Sacramento, invited the Sisters of Mercy of Doon to staff the school. In August of that year, Sister Mary de Pazzi McKeough, Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart Troy, Sister Mary Laurence O’Dea, Sister Mary Rosario Ryan, Sister Mary Assumpta White, and Sister Mary Kieran O’Neill arrived in Fair Oaks to pioneer the work.</p>
  <p>The school opened in September 1959, with students enrolled in grades one through five. In June 1963, the first class of Eight graders graduated and a Kindergarten program was added. In addition, a full time Physical Education teacher was employed to instruct all grades. In September 1977, a part-time Spanish teacher was employed to teach Spanish, and in September 1991, the Spanish program was revised.</p>
  <p>  An accelerated math program for qualified students in grades seven and eight began in 1979; the program was extended in 1980 to include students in grades four through eight.</p>

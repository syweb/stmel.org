<h2>Faith Families</h2>

<div class="col col-large">

<p>  To promote fellowship and nurture a sense of community at St. Mel School all 
  students in grades TK through Eighth are grouped into Faith Families. Each 
  Faith Family is headed by an Eighth grader and usually consists of nine 
  other students, one from each grade. Incoming new students are welcomed 
  into an existing Faith Family. These families attend Mass together each 
  week and participate in various group activities during the school year.</p>

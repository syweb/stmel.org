<h2>Parent Participation Policy:</h2> 
As registered members of St. Mel School, it is expected that families will be required to provide support services which will benefit the school community. For the 2009-2010 year, we will require 45 hours of service from each family (30 hours for a single parent). The hours will be mandatory and your child’s continued registration at St. Mel School will be dependent on the fulfillment of these hours. Ten of the above hours must be worked in a major fundraiser (auction, crab feed, harvest festival/craft fair and/or wine event). Each family is also required to donate $350 to the Parent Club. A payment of $50 is due at registration and cash or item donation valued at greater than or equal to $300 to the auction, crab feed or wine event is required.

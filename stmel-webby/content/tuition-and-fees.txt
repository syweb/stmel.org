<h3>St. Mel’s Parishioner Rate:</h3> 
The rate for families who are active participants in the life of this parish. “Active Parishioner” are those whose presence enriches the life of the parish community and who regularly attend Sunday Mass at St. Mel’s Church and use the Sunday envelopes. This status will be determined annually by the pastor. 
<h3>St. Mel’s Non-Parishioner Rate:</h3> 
The rate for all families who do not conform to the above definition. 
<h3>Parent Participation Policy:</h3> 
As registered members of St. Mel School, it is expected that families will be required to provide support services which will benefit the school community. For the 2008-2009 year, we will require 45 hours of service from each family (30 hours for a single parent). The hours will be mandatory and your child’s continued registration at St. Mel School will be dependent on the fulfillment of these hours. Ten of the above hours must be worked in a major fundraiser (auction, crab feed, harvest festival/craft fair and/or wine event). Each family is also required to donate $350.00 to the Parent Club. A payment of $50.00 is due at registration and cash or item donation valued at greater than or equal to $300 to the auction, crab feed or wine event is required

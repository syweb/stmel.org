<h3>WHY CHOOSE ST. MEL?</h3>

<h3>Our Curriculum</h3>
	<p>Faith is central to all learning that takes place at St. Mel Catholic 
		School. Our TK class is fully involved in the school faith community. TK 
		students attend Mass and prayer services and participate in school-wide 
		service projects. The goal of TK is to provide a fun, positive, small-group 
		setting that encourages a love of learning, develops a sense of community, 
		and prepares your child for Kindergarten in a faith- filled environment. 
		This is achieved through a combination of developmental, multi-sensory, 
		academic and social experiences.
	</p>
	
<h3>Enrichment Activities</h3>
	<p>The TK program at St. Mel School allows each child the opportunity to 
	participate on a weekly basis in enrichment activities including: Spanish, 
	Physical Education, Technology Lab, and visiting the school Library. Our 
	program will provide many opportunities for each child to achieve the 
	knowledge and skills necessary to prepare them for Kindergarten. 
	</p>

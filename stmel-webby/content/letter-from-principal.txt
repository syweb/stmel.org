<h2>Letter from the Principal</h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
  <p>Dear Prospective School Family,</p>
  <p>I invite you to consider a Catholic education for your child at St. Mel Catholic School. You have good reason to have confidence in St. Mel School. When your child enters St. Mel in August, you can rest assured that he/she will receive a superior education. The Western Accreditation of Schools & Colleges (WASC) and the Western Catholic Education Association awarded St. Mel School with the highest rating possible. As you can see,your child enters a school where academic excellence is part of the culture. For evidence of St. Mel’s curriculum
  standards and religious education program, go to <a href="http://www.stmelschool.org/" title="St Mel School homepage">www.stmelschool.org</a> under Classroom Corner. Additionally, we are proud to include ancillary academic programs such as: computer/technology education provided by Computer Explorers Integrated Technology Resource Program; an art docent program encompassing art history, art forms,and hands-on art experiences; a science lab that provides the student with a comprehensive science experience
  that is structured to maximize direct student involvement.</p>
  <p>Your child benefits from dynamic, daily faith formation through religious education. St. Mel offers weekly opportunities to attend Mass and other liturgical celebrations that are intended to support the faith that you have built at home. We recognize and respect that parents are the primary educators of their child. Realizing that our efforts form a partnership, I ask you to join us in our work to make your child’s school experience rewarding and successful.</p>
  <p>St. Mel School offers access to a variety of activities that address the needs of the whole child. An extensive athletic program is available to students in grades 1st – 8th including flag football, volleyball, basketball, bowling, cross- country, golf and track. Student Council provides students in grades 6th – 8th opportunities to practice leadership, public speaking skills and develop organizational abilities. Choir, drama and an annual talent show give students an opportunity to showcase their many talents.</p>
  <p>In order to provide continuity to your child’s school day, we offer a well-supervised Extension Program. The Extension Program provides students in grades TK – 8th with opportunities to complete their homework, engage in fun, recreational, creative and stimulating activities before and after school in a safe, comfortable environment on campus. A Hot Lunch Program is offered during the school day as well.</p>
  <p>Your child will be surrounded at St. Mel School by a caring and loving community of students, faculty, staff and volunteers who value each other, and most importantly, your child. I truly believe that our family environment promotes learning, spiritual growth, fellowship, stability, and safety for the entire school community.</p>
  <p>As you can see, spiritual growth and faith development underscore everything we do for your child while he or she is a student here at St. Mel School. In addition to a campus tour, St. Mel School offers a visitation program for prospective students applying to grades 2nd – 8th to experience a typical day at our school.

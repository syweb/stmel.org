  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>The task of educating the young belongs primarily with parents. St. Mel School endeavors to assist the parents in this role by creating a Catholic environment, which will promote the spiritual, intellectual, emotional, physical, and social growth of the child. Many opportunities are provided for development of right judgment and moral values, creative thinking, and the acceptance of leadership roles. Self-worth is developed in students, as they are encouraged to contribute their share in the work of building a Catholic community. Our success as Catholic educators is significantly enhanced by parental support. In addition, family life is strengthened by the active participation of its members in the Catholic school and parish.</p>

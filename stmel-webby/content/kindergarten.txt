<h2>Kindergarten</h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">

<p>The 2012-13 Kindergarten curriculum at St. Mel School will follow 
California’s Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts, Literacy 
in History/Social Studies, and Science and Technical Subjects and follow 
diocesan standards for Math.
</p>
<p>Curriculum focuses on the whole child with plenty of opportunities for 
“hands on” learning and movement. Lessons are taught in dynamic small and 
large group settings. We emphasize getting to know the student’s learning 
styles so we can reach all learners in a variety of activities that are both 
challenging and stimulating. To make learning more impactful, lessons are 
related to real life experiences in a fun and positive way!
</p>
<p>In addition to the Common Core curriculum, our Kindergarten students 
participate in Spanish, Music, Physical Education, and Technology Lab taught 
by specialized teachers on a weekly basis. During the academic year the 
Kindergarten program also incorporates cultural and holiday celebrations 
including: International Peace Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Chinese New Year, Valentine’s Day, Mardi Gras, St. 
Patrick’s Day, Easter and Cinco de Mayo. Field trips are included to 
support and expand classroom learning.

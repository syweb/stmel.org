<h2>The Extension Philosophy </h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
<p>St. Mel Extension Program supports and supplements the family by providing a safe and comfortable environment for the children of St. Mel School. We provide a link between school and home, fulfilling the needs of the children, parents and our parish community.
</p>

<p>We are an Extended Day Program of St. Mel School. Therefore, we adhere to the same philosophies, rules and regulations as stated in the School Parent-Student Handbook.
</p>

<p>While the school has a structured environment, our Extended Care Program will provide a flexible setting for relaxation and learning. This will be done by providing adult supervisors who are sensitive to the psychological and physical needs of each child.
</p>

<p> In following the philosophy and goals of the school, we will provide a 
bridge between the school and home environment. The main components of this program include:  snack, study hall, supervision, recreation, and enrichment activities.  We hope that your child will relax, thrive and develop closer friendships in a safe, caring, Catholic, Christian atmosphere.  

<p>St. Mel Extension Program does not discriminate on the basis of race,
color, sex, age, national origin or handicap.

<h2>The Extension Philosophy </h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
<p>St. Mel Extension Program supports and supplements the family by providing
a safe and comfortable environment for the children of St. Mel School. We
provide a link between school and home, fulfilling the needs of the
children, parents and our parish community.
</p>

<p>We are an Extended Day Program of St. Mel School. Therefore, we adhere to
the same philosophies, rules and regulations as stated in the School
Parent-Student Handbook.
</p>

<p>While the school has a structured environment, our Extended Care Program
will provide a flexible setting for relaxation and learning. This will be
done by providing adult supervisors who are sensitive to the psychological
and physical needs of each child.
</p>

<p>In following the philosophy and goals of the school, we will provide a
bridge between the school and home environment. The component parts of
this program include snack, homework supervision, recreation, enrichment
activities, and a rest period for Kindergarten students. We hope that your
child will relax, thrive and develop closer friendships in a safe, caring,
Catholic, Christian atmosphere.
</p>

<p>St. Mel Extension Program does not discriminate on the basis of race,
color, sex, age, national origin or handicap.

<h2>Building the Future. One Child at a Time</h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
  <p>At St. Mel School we strive to recognize and discover the uniqueness of 
	every individual and believe that the fundamental richness of the world 
	comes from the uniqueness of each one. St. Mel School seeks to immerse our 
	students, actually and virtually, in a population of students, faculty, and 
	staff that is diverse not only in terms of talents and abilities, but also 
	in terms of ethnicity, gender, faith, economics, and cultural background. 
	This brings a richness, breadth of exposure, and life experience that is 
	necessary to a full-rounded education.</p>
	
	<p>The mission of St. Mel School is to promote academic excellence within a 
	Catholic, faith-filled environment. A St. Mel education empowers students 
	to become active, responsible Catholic adults whose lives reflect the Gospel 
	values. The school's philosophy states that it is our job to provide 
	opportunities for the development of right judgment and moral values, 
	creative and critical thinking, and the acceptance of leadership roles. We 
	focus on the successful development of the whole child and strive to meet 
	the needs of all our students and families through various avenues to ensure 
	that our student body is reflective of the community as a whole.</p>
	
	<p>Understanding and respecting differences, and being enriched by them, rather 
	than threatened, is part of our educational task. If we can create an 
	environment where our students are learning directly with and from others 
	from different backgrounds, we will be enriching the students' lives and 
	increasing understanding about the world in which they live. As Pope John 
	Paul II said, "Faith leads us beyond ourselves. It leads us directly to 
	God."</p>

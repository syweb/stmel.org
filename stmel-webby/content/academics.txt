<h3>Stewardship</h3>
<p>For over 53 years, St. Mel Catholic School continues to be a strong Catholic educational institution in Sacramento County educating generations of students with a simple mission of "Integrating Faith with Academic Excellence". One key element needed to grow and sustain a viable, innovative parish school program is STEWARDSHIP.
</p>
<p>Stewardship is based on the idea that “all we have” and “all we are” comes from God. Stewardship calls for us to share ourselves, to be a holy people, to step up and to take the risk of walking with our savior, Jesus Christ. Stewardship is not a program; rather it is an attitude, a way of life. We are all called to be disciples and caretakers of God’s many gifts. In order to thank God for our many blessings, we must give back a portion of the time, talent, and treasure that with which God has blessed us.</p>
<p>
Over the years, St. Mel School has been the humble recipient of various stewardship efforts. In particular, an Endowment fund specifically designed to assist families with tuition assistance who seek a Catholic education for their children. Also, the "Bridging the Gap" annual fund that assists in supporting the school's budget as tuition does not cover the entire cost. Over the years, St. Mel Parents Club has fostered fellowship through fun-raising and fundraising. I continue to be amazed by the talents of our parents who have given so generously and enthusiastically from one decade to the next. These contributions of time, talent, and treasure, along with the unwavering support of the School Advisory Commission, have been instrumental in helping St. Mel School evaluate and shape our mission as we move into the future. The school also receives generous donations from our parishioners. They often tell me how impressed they are with the job we are doing providing a strong Catholic faith development along with educating the whole child.</p>
<p>
As school Principal, I have the responsibility of promoting stewardship among the students, faculty, and staff. At St. Mel School, the concept of stewardship is part of our faith development. We integrate stewardship into various areas of our school programs – morning prayer, liturgy, assemblies, Student Learning Expectations, and through participating in community service projects (school-wide, classroom, and individually). In particular, as part of their preparation to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation, our 7th & 8th graders volunteer 20 hours during the school year. This provides the school an opportunity to network with social service and outreach organizations.</p>
<p>
I look forward to the rest of this school year with gratitude and an appreciation for our history along with great hope for our future! As St. Francis of Assisi said,"It is in giving that we receive". Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jnagel@stmelschool.org">jnagel@stmelschool.org</a>.</p>

<h2>The Whole Child</h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
  <p>Our collective goal at St. Mel Catholic School is to educate the whole child 
	in an atmosphere of faith and academic excellence. I would like to share 
	with you briefly how St. Mel School prepares each student to have the tools 
	they need to fulfill their roles as good citizens, productive employees and 
	compassionate leaders.</p>
	
	<p>First and foremost, we are committed to the safety of our students, staff 
	and families. This is evidenced as you enter our gated campus. We 
	consistently follow safety procedures and routines. Second, we practice 
	good health habits and offer Physical Education classes from TK -through 8th 
	grade that encourage healthy behaviors for a lifetime, and our Hot Lunch 
	Program offers healthy food choices. Third, St. Mel School provides a 
	well-rounded curriculum for all students including rigorous classes, 
	resource programs, a wide array of co-curricular and extra-curricular 
	activities and many athletic programs. Next, teachers use skills that make 
	learning interesting and relevant for their students by incorporating 
	various modalities to address different learning styles. Our curriculum 
	supports creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and other 
	twenty-first century skills. Finally, spiritual growth and faith 
	development underscore everything we do for your child.</p>
	
	<p>I assure you St. Mel School is committed to integrating these components to 
	achieve an optimal learning environment. A Catholic education at St. Mel 
	School gives your child an extra "tool" in their tool box for life.</p>

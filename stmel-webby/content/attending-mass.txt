      <h2>Attending Mass</h2>
      <div class="col col-large">
        <p>Students in TK through Eight grade attend 8:30 a.m. Mass each Friday.  Grades 2nd through 8th rotate on a weekly basis preparing for the Mass.  Students have the opportunity to be lectors and be responsible for the Bible readings, responsorial psalms, prayers of the faithful, singing, altar serving and offertory processions.  In addition, the school choir performs at these Masses. </p>
		<p>Students also attend 8:30 a.m. Mass on Holy Days of Obligation that occur during the school year. </p>
		<p>To build community, our TK and Kindergarten students are invited to sit with their Seventh grade buddies and students in First grade sit with their 8th grade buddies.  Parents as always invited and encouraged to attend school Masses.  We all benefit from the fellowship of sharing and practicing our Catholic faith in community.  </p>

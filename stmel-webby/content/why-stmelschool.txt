	<h3>Stewardship</h3>
	<p>For over 53 years, St. Mel Catholic School continues to be a strong Catholic educational institution in Sacramento County educating generations of students with a simple mission of "Integrating Faith with Academic Excellence". One key element needed to grow and sustain a viable, innovative parish school program is STEWARDSHIP.
	</p>
	<p>Stewardship is based on the idea that “all we have” and “all we are” comes from God. Stewardship calls for us to share ourselves, to be a holy people, to step up and to take the risk of walking with our savior, Jesus Christ. Stewardship is not a program; rather it is an attitude, a way of life. We are all called to be disciples and caretakers of God’s many gifts. In order to thank God for our many blessings, we must give back a portion of the time, talent, and treasure that with which God has blessed us.</p>
	<p>
	Over the years, St. Mel School has been the humble recipient of various stewardship efforts. In particular, an Endowment fund specifically designed to assist families with tuition assistance who seek a Catholic education for their children. Also, the "Bridging the Gap" annual fund that assists in supporting the school's budget as tuition does not cover the entire cost. Over the years, St. Mel Parents Club has fostered fellowship through fun-raising and fundraising. I continue to be amazed by the talents of our parents who have given so generously and enthusiastically from one decade to the next. These contributions of time, talent, and treasure, along with the unwavering support of the School Advisory Commission, have been instrumental in helping St. Mel School evaluate and shape our mission as we move into the future. The school also receives generous donations from our parishioners. They often tell me how impressed they are with the job we are doing providing a strong Catholic faith development along with educating the whole child.</p>
	<p>
	As school Principal, I have the responsibility of promoting stewardship among the students, faculty, and staff. At St. Mel School, the concept of stewardship is part of our faith development. We integrate stewardship into various areas of our school programs – morning prayer, liturgy, assemblies, Student Learning Expectations, and through participating in community service projects (school-wide, classroom, and individually). In particular, as part of their preparation to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation, our 7th & 8th graders volunteer 20 hours during the school year. This provides the school an opportunity to network with social service and outreach organizations.</p>
	<p>
	I look forward to the rest of this school year with gratitude and an appreciation for our history along with great hope for our future! As St. Francis of Assisi said,"It is in giving that we receive". Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jnagel@stmelschool.org">jnagel@stmelschool.org</a>.</p>

	<h3>Testimonials</h3>
  <p>I’ve always regarded the reference to one’s college-- Alma
	Mater or “Nourishing Mother” as a bit over the top. But after reflecting
	more on the education of our children, I can’t help but think that it
	wouldn’t be a bad term for the school providing K through 8th grade
	education. Outside of the family, isn’t a developing child most influenced
	by his or her school? After all, they are surrounded by their peers,
	authority figures and the curriculum they must learn. My wife, Cristina, and
	I appreciate the fact that in spite of the academic challenges and
	increasing demands placed on teachers to raise test scores St. Mel’s has not
	lost the focus of teaching virtue and helping us parents to develop good
	character in our kids. The children at St. Mel’s are prepared well for the
	intellectual challenges of high school but they are also taught to use
	reason AND their faith in preparation for life.</p>
	
	<p>We have no doubt that the Catholic Christian principle that each human
	being is uniquely dignified by God’s love is at the front of St. Mel’s
	School. The school has shown us its mettle by focusing on the formation of
	our children’s characters. It does this by rewarding charitable works
	(volunteer hours) and recognizing acts of kindness, justice, as well as the
	fortitude required for excellence in the classroom, playing field and
	society in general. When we interact with Mrs. Nagel, a teacher or Mrs.
	DeLuca, from the school extension program, we are reassured that our kids
	are not lost in the constant activity that flows past in a typical school
	day. When an issue has arisen, we have found school staff and administration
	to be responsive and thoughtful in its recommendations. There is an
	integrity that shows through in each and every person we have interacted
	with at St. Mel’s. The school mission is reflected in the sense of vocation
	we have observed. We have come to the conclusion that a truly Catholic
	school is only as good as the Pastor and religious that lead and support it.
	Fr. Sweeney and Fr. George are great examples of real men in the priesthood
	and are undoubtedly being used by God to inspire others to follow them to
	serve with passion.</p>
	
	<p>This is why our family stands behind St. Mel’s School and Parish and
	hope any prospective parent who may read this will consider making St. Mel’s
	their children’s Alma Mater.</p>

	<p>We chose St. Mel Catholic School because we wanted an environment where our
	children are taught the same morals we teach at home; and where they are
	challenged academically.</p>
	<p>The teachers at St. Mel have consistently demonstrated that they are
	dedicated to educating, as well as genuinely caring for, their students. We
	currently have two children at St. Mel and plan on sending our third.</p>
	<p>The school has been a wonderful experience not only for our children, but
	for our family. We have found a warm sense of community where teachers and
	parents work together to help develop academic excellence, respect for one
	another and the basic moral values of life. Our children have learned life
	skills at St. Mel that they will carry with them throughout life.</p>
	<p>St. Mel Catholic School has truly been a blessing to our family!</p>

	<p>Selecting the right school for kids is a difficult decision to make.
	Parents are often faced with making the tough decisions to ensure that the
	school that they chose is the right environment for their children. The
	selection criteria often includes; choosing a school with a strong academic
	background, faith based , and creates a family environment.</p>
	
	<p>For us, we were introduced to St. Mel’s by my brother who has three children
	that attended St. Mel’s. All three kids have received a very strong
	education that has allowed them to go to good universities, and most
	importantly were raised with good values.</p>
	
	<p>Once we learned about St. Mel’s school, the decision was very easy for us to
	make. We made the decision to send our kids to St. Mel’s school. St. Mel’s
	School has all of the main criteria that we were looking for. It has a good
	academic curriculum, excellent faith based environment that supports our
	values, and the parents are like having a big family.</p>
	
	<p>We enjoy going to St. Mel’s, the teachers are very supportive and they
	ensure that the children are provided the opportunity to learn and prepare
	them to be independent.</p>
	
	<p>We enjoy all of the school activities; it truly feels like a big family
	gathering!</p>
	
	<p>My husband and I want to thank you for creating a lovely environment for our
	kids. We feel very fortunate to have placed our kids in a place where they
	are receiving good education, enforce our values and a place where they feel
	like home.</p>

<h2>Welcome from Principal</h2>
<div class="col col-x-large">
  <p>St. Mel School is proud to carry on the traditions from our founders, the Sisters of Mercy.  Since the doors opened 50 years ago, St. Mel School has graduated outstanding young students on their way to being successful high school students.  We are a TK- 8th grade Catholic co-educational elementary and junior high school located in Fair Oaks, California.  The school is accredited by the Western Catholic Educational Association and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.  Our enrollment for the 2009-2010 academic school year is 275 students. </p>

	<p>We are dedicated to serving our student body and their families by providing an education grounded in the Catholic tradition.  We want our graduates to become valuable members of the greater community by <b>integrating faith with academic excellence</b>.</p>

	<p>The core curriculum is academically challenging and is designed to help students prepare for rigorous high school pursuits. Beyond the classroom, students at St. Mel are offered many co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, including athletics, academic competitions, art docent program, choir, a drama production and countless special events occurring throughout the year. </p>

	<p>Our students achieve academic success allowing them to be successful in high school and beyond, by providing a strong, spiritual and academic program that enables them to be productive lifelong learners and faith-filled stewards.  The school perpetuates a strong sense of Catholic service and leadership opportunities for students.  The parents are visibly active in the school life and faith formation of their children.  There is active and supportive involvement by the Pastor of St. Mel Church and the Principal. </p>

	<p>Our picturesque six acre campus is completely gated providing security and safety for our students.  St. Mel Catholic Church is situated on this site.  Our campus includes a new science lab, a resource center, an upgraded technology lab, gym, cafeteria, large classrooms, grassy playing fields, a community garden, basketball courts and a new play structure.  </p>

	<p>St. Mel School has a warm and friendly atmosphere.  This special quality stems from our long tradition, family oriented environment and highly qualified faculty whose tireless effort is easily observed by the students. It is a place where everyone is treated with respect.  The faculty is committed to challenging each student’s potential for achievement, and to differentiate instruction to meet the learning needs of all students.  </p>

	<p>I have been Principal of St. Mel School since June 1990, and I am thrilled to be here.  I remain very impressed with the caliber of this faculty and staff and with the commitment of the personnel towards St. Mel School students.  The feedback which we receive consistently as our students enter high school throughout the local community is that they are well-prepared.  I am a product of the Catholic school system from elementary school to post-graduate.  I have taught and have been an administrator in Catholic schools most of my adult life. </p>

	<p>My husband Bill and I have been married for 38 years and have two St. Mel graduates, Brian (‘87) and Stephanie (’88).  My family and I have been most impressed with the caliber of St. Mel School as a site for the education, social and continuing moral development of our children.  St. Mel School provides an atmosphere that is stable, nurturing, student-centered, family-centered, and grounded in Catholic values.  </p>

	<p>I hope the information on this page has helped you become familiar with our fine school and with me.  I am extremely proud of our students, parents, faculty, and staff.  We are proud to claim that we provide a family-oriented community in which children learn to achieve their best in a loving, supportive and challenging academic environment.  </p>

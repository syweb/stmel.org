<h2>Our History</h2>
<div class="col col-equal">
  <p>St. Mel School was established in 1959 to serve the needs of the growing parish which began in 1949.  Reverend William Hogan, the Pastor, at the request of the Most Reverend Joseph L. Chucked, Bishop of Sacramento, invited the Sisters of Mercy of Don to staff the school.   In August of that year, Sister Mary de Piazzi McVeigh, Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart Troy, Sister Mary Laurence O’Dea, Sister Mary Rosario Ryan, Sister Mary Assumption White, and Sister Mary Kieran O’Neill arrived in Fair Oaks to pioneer the work.</p>
  
  <p>The school opened in September 1959, with students enrolled in grades one through five.  In June 1963, the first class of eighth graders graduated and a Kindergarten program was added.  In addition, a full time Physical Education teacher was employed to instruct all grades.  In 1976, Father Richard Doheny was appointed pastor of St. Mel Parish.  Father Doheny oversaw further acquisitions of property, construction and improvements for the parish and school.  His devoted commitment to Catholic education was expressed in strong spiritual and financial support for St. Mel School.  The parish community has been a constant source of spiritual and financial support for the school.  In March of 2006, Father Doheny passed away, and Father Liam McSweeney assumed the position of pastor.  The tradition and legacy of Father Doheny is continued with Father McSweeney.     In September of 2010, Father McSweeney appointed newly-ordained parochial vicar Father Mauricio Hurtado as the school chaplain. </p>
  
  <p>In September 1977, a part-time Spanish teacher was employed to teach Spanish, and in September 1991, the Spanish program was revised.  An accelerated math program for qualified students in grades seven and eight began in 1979; the program was extended in 1980 to include students in grades four through eight.
  In 1984, computer classes were offered to students in grades Kindergarten through eight.  In 1996, a fine arts program was incorporated into the curriculum. The Extension Program opened its doors to students before and after school in 1998.   </p>

<div class="col col-equal">
  <p>The Art Docent Program which includes art appreciation and hands-on projects begun in 2004 and continues under parent direction as an integral part of the Fine Arts curriculum. Transitional Kindergarten (TK) started in August 2004.  Fundraising and completion of a portable building to house a new science lab for the students was realized in the spring of 2006.  Science equipment, a SMART Board and an in-focus projector are part of the science lab.  The new portable building also houses the resource classroom.  In the fall of 2005, a resource teacher was hired to assist students, faculty, and parents in the evaluation, instruction, and guidance of all students with special needs.  St. Mel School supports and implements the Individual Educational Plans for students identified with special educational needs in grades Kindergarten through eight.  Early intervention, accommodations, and modifications are foremost in the success of each student.  To improve and ensure student safety, the central campus perimeter was defined by a gated fence and a twenty four hour security system was installed in the summer of 2006.   </p>

  <p>In the fall of 2007, the school’s computer program went under the direction and operation of Computer Explorers.  This comprehensive program provides a TK through 8 computer science curriculum that enables students to meet and exceed the National Educational Technology Standards, and integrates core-curriculum into the project-based learning.  In the fall of 2008, the computer lab was reconfigured to accommodate larger student groups.  At that time the lab was equipped with twenty-two new flat screen computers and supporting technical equipment.  Technological advances in the last five years include establishment of a school website, and Internet access for all school, staff, and parent communication, such as:  Schoolyard, All Alert System, Wiki, and an on-line grading program.  In 2009, the lower student bathrooms were completely renovated along with the faculty room.  In 2010, four SMART Boards were installed into various grade levels. </p>

  <p>Enrollment has remained constant marking the 50th Anniversary of St. Mel School and completing the WCEA/WASC accreditation process in 2009 in which the school received a full term 6-year accreditation, the highest rating a school can achieve.  The school population continues to be predominantly Catholic.  In 1990, Mrs. Janet Nagel was appointed the first lay principal of St. Mel School.  The commitment and direction of the Sisters of Mercy remain a vital force in the implementation of the philosophy of the school.
